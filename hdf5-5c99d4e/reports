REPEAT BUG BY:
   [What you did to get the error; include test program or session
    transcript if at all possible.  If you include a program, make
    sure it depends only on libraries in the HDF distribution, not
    on any vendor or third-party libraries.  Please be specific;
    if we can't reproduce it, we can't fix it. Tell us exactly what
    we should see when the program is run.  NOTE:  It helps us if 
    the example program is written in C and can be run easily on Unix]
